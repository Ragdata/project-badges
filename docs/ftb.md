[FOR THE BADGE](https://forthebadge.com/) is a website created by [BRAVE UX](https://www.braveux.com/) to decry our obsession with badges, and which provides a selection of badges that you can use to ~~become part of the problem~~ join with them in shaking your head at this current state of affairs.  They also have a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/BraveUX/for-the-badge) that you can fork and submit a Pull Request with changes if you'd like to ~~add to this misery~~ contribute to their project.
