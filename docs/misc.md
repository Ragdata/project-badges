## No Maintenance Intended

Officially, this is the first badge I'm adding to this project because I think it's one of the most important ever created! (Notice how it's NOT on the "Fun Badges" page?).  This badge is intended to be displayed on those side projects that you've always wanted to get out there, but will NEVER have the time or inclination to maintain.  Indispensable if you ask me!
