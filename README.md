For better or worse, this is a documentation project dedicated entirely to those tiny, colourful infograms we love to collect on our README's.  Not only is it intended to be as exhaustive a list as can made with as little effort possible, it is also intended to be an homage to the progenitors of 'the badge' and in through this project hope to both learn and teach about the origins of what has arguably become a standard of sorts within the open source community.

Contributions from the community are welcomed - after all, who am I to turn away anyone brave enough to have their name associated with a project like this?  Details about how you can do so can be found a little further down this very page.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome, and because we're using the [AllContributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot) bot, it's not just 'code' contributions which will be recognised:

### Contribute the 'old-fashioned' way

Fork the project, make your changes, and then submit a pull-request and you will be forever enshrined in the "Hall of the Makers" and will be entitled to display an ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE badge on your forked version of the project (that I am yet to design and / or implement ... but don't sweat it, I'll get it done).

### Contribute 'the way the kids are doing it'

Because we're using the [AllContributors]() bot, you can also officially contribute to the project by commenting on an Issue or Pull Request asking `@all-contributors` to acknowledge your contribution like so:

````
@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>
````

and your contribution will be automagically recorded by the contributions bot - AND you'll still be entitled to display that ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE badge on any of your own projects / or your profile page should you be brave enough to want to admit to contributing to a project like this one.

The really cool bit is that the bot will parse your request using [basic Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/all-contributors/app/blob/master/lib/parse-comment.js) to try and determine your intent, so even a half-hearted contribution such as:

> Hey @all-contributors bot, I reckon I deserve to be added as a contributor becaue I suggested that Ragdata should make the icon of the ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE Project Contributor's Badge look like an anus - love, @myusername 

... will be recognised and will be recorded along with other contributors and entitle you to display the ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE Project Contributor's Badge on your profile or repositories.

And, although I shouldn't feel the need to mention it, I do want to make it absolutely clear that ANYONE who suggests that the icon of the ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE Project Contributor's Badge should look like an anus will ABSOLUTELY NOT be entitled to display the ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE Project Contributor's Badge on their profile or other repositories here at GitHub. 

... I mean, you've looked around this place, haven't you? ... just saying ...
