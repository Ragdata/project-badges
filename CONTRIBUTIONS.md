## How To Contribute

Contributions are welcome, and because we're using the [AllContributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot) bot, it's not just 'code' contributions which will be recognised.

Simply click on the [Issues](https://github.com/Ragdata/project-badges/issues) tab of our GitHub Repository and click the big green "New Issue" button on the right-hand side of the page and write your submission.

To give you an idea of what we're looking for and what you'll get credited for, if you make a submission that roughly falls under one of the following categories, you can pretty much guarantee that you'll see your name on the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) page:

* Badges that we have missed in our survey of GitHub Projects
* Your idea for a new badge that we should create for the community

If your submission is accepted, you'll be recognised on our Contributors page, AND you'll be granted the right to use and display one of our [ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE Project Badges Project Badges](https://github.com/Ragdata/project-badges/wiki/ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE-PROJECT-BADGES)!
    
If your submission happened to be an idea which requires a bit of scripting and allows us to create a new service for the community, then you'll be granted the rights to use and display an [EVEN-MORE-ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE Project Badges Project Badge](https://github.com/Ragdata/project-badges/wiki/ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE-PROJECT-BADGES#EVEN-MORE-EXCLUSIVE)!
